This is where we write the intro to the tutorial


The stuff we need to include:
- why does this tutorial matter for devops
- background (whatever that is supposed to mean), we can probably include prerequisites here
- intended learning outcomes
- Mention that there are some prerequisites that need to be  for making the bot functional. we will mention them here and show how to do them, but they're not part of the bot-making tutorial explicitly.
