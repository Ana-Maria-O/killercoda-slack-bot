Welcome to this tutorial on making a Slackbot!

In this tutorial we're going to show you how to easily program a simple slackbot using Python.

The kind of bot that we are going to create here is connected to a certain website and can give alerts on Slack if the webiste is up, or if there are any errors that appear when trying to connect to the website.

Such a bot can be quite useful in a DevOps environment. As anything related to DevOps goes, there are many tools which a team can employ to monitor the state of their server. Such a bot is very useful in the cases of small teams that do not have a big budget. Monitoring tools can be expensive, and as such it can be very useful if there is an easy way for the whole team to get announced if at any point there are problems with their server during the production phase. The bot that we will be showing here is very easy to set up, and provides automatic updates on a website's availability. This allows a development team to monitor the status of their website in real-time and to quickly be announced of availability issues.

These are the intended learning outcomes of this tutorial:
- You get to become more familar with Slack, as it has gained popularity at a very fast rate
- You learn how to easily integrate slackbots into the production process
- How to connect a slackbot to a specific server or website
- How to monitor the status of a server/website using a slackbot
- How to perform said status checks periodically and automatically

Happy learning!
