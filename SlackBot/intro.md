This is where we write the intro to the tutorial


The stuff we need to include:
- why does this tutorial matter for devops
- intended learning outcomes (you get more familiar with slack, integrate slackbots into the production process, how to connect a slackbot to a specific server/website, monitor status of server with slackbot, periodic and automatic status checks)
- Mention that there are some prerequisites that need to be  for making the bot functional. we will mention them here and show how to do them, but they're not part of the bot-making tutorial explicitly.
