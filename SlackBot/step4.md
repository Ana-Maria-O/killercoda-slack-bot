Now that we know that the bot is connected to the right channel, it is time to program it.

We begin by importing all the necessary packages:

```
import os
import time
import requests
from slack_sdk import WebClient
from slack_sdk.errors import SlackApiError
```

Set your API token after the imports

```
# Set the API token for your Slack bot
client = WebClient(token="<Your_Slack_Token_Here>")
```

To finalize this step, choose a web address to bind your bot to and the status code you want to monitor it for. In this example, we're monitoring that the bot can successfully reach Google:
```
# Define the URL and status code to check
url = "https://www.google.com/"
status_code = 200
```
